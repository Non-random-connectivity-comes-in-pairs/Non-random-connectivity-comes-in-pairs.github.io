* Get Started

Start by creating a new post (http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) one of the categories listed in ~_config.yml~. It will appear in the navigation on the left once recompiled. Or use the supplied script to make creating pages easier:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ruby bin/jekyll-page "Some Page Title" ref
#+END_SRC

** Don't Forget

- Add your own content to this page (i.e. ~index.md~) and change the ~title~
- Change ~title~ and ~subtitle~ defined in ~config.yml~ for your site
- Set the ~baseurl~ in ~_config.yml~ for your repo if deploying to GitHub pages
